# How to Git
Unlike other version control system, which are delta-based version control, git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.

## Initializing a repo
```bash
git init

git --version # Output git version 2.46.0
```
## Cloning a repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/satishkarki/satishkarki.github.io.git # uses https protocol

git:// or user@server:path/to/repo.git # uses SSH protocol, more on this later
```
